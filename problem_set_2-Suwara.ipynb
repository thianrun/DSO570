    "# Problem Set 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create Python code to automate a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem set assesses your mastery of course content in Week 2, which includes lists, dictionaries, and for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Steps for Each Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the prompt and summarize the task in your own words, using as few words as possible for ease of comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pretend to be the computer program that you are trying to create. Examine the sample inputs and manually produce the appropriate results. Afterward, verify the correctness of your logic by comparing with the given sample outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write on a scrap piece of paper step-by-step instructions so that someone else can pretend to be the computer program and produce the appropriate results for any possible inputs. These instructions should target a human audience who does not know the problem description and only has your instructions as guide. Refer to these instructions as your \"plan\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. On another scrap piece of paper, write fragments of Python code to implement each step in your plan (from Step 3), focusing especially on the trickiest parts of the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Following your plan (from Step 3) and code fragments (from Step 4), type Python code into a new Jupyter notebook cell to solve the given problem. You should type incrementally and run the code whenever you added a small chunk, so as to correct errors as you go. It may also be helpful to print intermediate results to verify that the code indeed is carrying out the logic described in your plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Run your code with the sample inputs and verify that the outputs are exactly the same as the sample outputs. Try also with other inputs that you make up and manually check that your program is correct. When there are Syntax errors, note that the arrows in the error message identify the line containing the error, and the last line of the error message contains a description of the error. You may find it helpful to Google for this description in the last line.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. After finishing all problems, click \"Kernel -> Restart & Run All\" and verify that your outputs for all problems continue to be correct. This ensures that someone else will be able to replicate your results when running your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Submit the .ipynb notebook file on Blackboard by the deadline. **Note that you only need to submit the code from Step 6, but Steps 1-5 are to guide your thinking process.** Steps 1-5 above are the essence of algorithmic thinking, which will be discussed in more detail in Weeks 3-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three possible scores you can get from submitting this assignment on time (submitting a blank file or one without any apparent effort does not count). Note that the rubric is designed to incentivize you to go for 100% mastery of the material, as the details matter a lot in programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Grade | Description |\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "| 5 out of 5 | Perfect submission with no significant errors. | \n",
    "| 4 out of 5 | Near perfect submission with one or more significant errors. |\n",
    "| 2 out of 5 | Apparent effort but far from perfect. |"

SALS has promised a plan that will yield the highest possible “exposure rating,” which is a measure of the ability to reach the appropriate demographic group and generate demand. The options for advertisements with their respective costs (per unit of advertising) and per-unit exposure ratings are given in the table below (K stands for thousands).\n",

    "Of course, certain restrictions exist for the advertising campaign. The client corporation has budgeted 800,000 dollars for the campaign, but to restrict overexposure to any particular audience it wants no more than 300,000 dollars put into any one category (Magazine, Newspaper, etc.). Also, to ensure a broad range of exposure, at least 100,000 dollars must be spent in each category. Finally, one has to purchase an integer number of units of each kind of advertisement, as no fractional units are allowed.\n",
